# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Refresher on DS in LeetCode (mainly arrays and linked list). Worked on designing my personal blog as well made with gatsby.

**Thoughts:** Was a bit slow initially to find solutions for DS problems as I avoided taking external help from google. Got better at it once I penned down the problem on a notebook and started brainstorming on the solution. Felt more productive and challenging when does this way. Reminder to have a notebook and pen while solving tricky DS and Algo questions.
Got some time to work on CSS layout of my personal blog that I have been working on for quite a while.

2. [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/93/linked-list/553/)

### Day 2: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued with DS in LeetCode (specifically Arrays and Strings). Started on low level API Desgin.

**Thoughts**: It was interesting to learn how APIs are designed- the entities and classes and how their relationships are established

**Link(s) to work:**

1. [Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/646/)
2. [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/879/)
3. [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/880/)

### Day 3: June 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with DS in LeetCode and learnt about the use of dummy linked list node which eases out the need for writing corner case scenarios when concerned with head and tail of the linked list. Also started on Design Patterns- Abstract Design Pattern

**Thoughts** Dummy Node for a linked list makes it so much more easier to write operations to be made on a linked list since it considers the edge cases involving the head and tail of the list.

1. [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/93/linked-list/603/)

### Day 4: June 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with DS in LeetCode for HashMaps and tables. Also read and implemented Design Patterns- Prototype Design Pattern

**Thoughts** Prototype Design Pattern gave a fresh new perspective on how to initialize predefined objects by cloning. Quite different from Factory Design Pattern which achieves it by sub classes.

**Link(s) to work**

1. [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/127/strings/883/)
2. [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/549/)
3. [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/578/)
4. [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/549/)
5. [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/93/linked-list/560/)

### Day 5: June 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with DS in LeetCode for Trees.

**Thoughts** Trees are a little trickier. But coming up with solutions is more or less the same once you get the hang of traversal

**Link(s) to work**

1. [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/94/trees/555/)
