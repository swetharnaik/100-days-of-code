# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Refresher on DS in LeetCode (mainly arrays and linked list). Worked on designing my personal blog as well made with gatsby.

**Thoughts:** Was a bit slow initially to find solutions for DS problems as I avoided taking external help from google. Got better at it once I penned down the problem on a notebook and started brainstorming on the solution. Felt more productive and challenging when does this way. Reminder to have a notebook and pen while solving tricky DS and Algo questions.
Got some time to work on CSS layout of my personal blog that I have been working on for quite a while.

### Day 2: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued with DS in LeetCode (specifically Arrays and Strings). Started on low level API Desgin.

**Thoughts**: It was interesting to learn how APIs are designed- the entities and classes and how their relationships are established

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
